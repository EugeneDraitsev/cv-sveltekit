	<p class="my-8">
		Hi, my name is Eugene and I'm a software engineer. I like math, science, cats, algorithms, good
		UX and other boring things. I started working as a developer in 2011 and received my system
		engineer diploma from BSUIR in 2013. Almost all my experience has been as a fullstack developer
		(Node/Java + Frontend). I really like functional programming, serverless approach and cloud
		platforms. Currently, I'm working as a fullstack developer, mainly with Svelte, React,
		TypeScript, k8s, and AWS/GCP
